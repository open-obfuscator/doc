Proguard is a Java bytecode optimizer and class names obfuscator developed by Guardsquare.
On the other hand, dProtect is an extension of Proguard with an additional **code** obfuscation
pipeline.

All the features of dProtect are highly grounded by Proguard and Proguard-Core.
We "just" added code obfuscation passes to Proguard to improve the protection against reverse engineering.
