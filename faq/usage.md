**Short answer: all the contexts** (personal, educational, commercial, etc) as long as it respects the
LLVM License ([Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/open-obfuscator/o-mvll/blob/main/LICENSE))
and Proguard License ([GPL v2.0](https://github.com/open-obfuscator/dProtect/blob/main/LICENSE)).

Open-obfuscator has been created to provide a free and open-source solution for reverse engineers **and**
mobile developers. On one hand, to practice, challenge, and improve reverse engineering techniques as well as
automation on obfuscated code. On the other hand, for developers to provide a solution to protect their applications.

You could use open-obfuscator for a commercial purposes but we don't aim at providing a commercial support.
