Yes, it already exists several open-source projects that aim at protecting code against reverse engineering.

Compare to these projects, O-MVLL is different in the API used to configure and obfuscate the native code
as well as in the design of some of obfuscation passes.
On the other hand, dProtect is rooted by Proguard which is known by Android developers and thus,
easier to integrate than other solutions.

In addition, this project is strongly attached to:

- Providing a clean and in-depth documentation
- Having an easy toolchain integration
- Exposing a user-friendly API
